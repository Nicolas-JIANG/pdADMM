# pdADMM: parallel deep learning Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers

This is a implementation of ADMM to achieve  model parallelism for the deep fully-connected neural network, as described in our paper:

Junxiang Wang, Zheng Chai, Yue Cheng, and Liang Zhao. Toward Model Parallelism for Deep Neural Network based on Gradient-free ADMM Framework. (ICDM 2020)

serial_pdADMM  is the source code of serial implementation of the pdADMM algorithm.

parallel_pdADMM is the source code of parallel implementation of the pdADMM algorithm.
